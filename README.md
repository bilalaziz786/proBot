Discord bot that would reply hey to your hi. Allows a user to search on google through discord. If the user types !google nodejs, it replies with top 5 links that are present on google.com  Functionality to search through search history. If a user uses !google to search for "nodejs" "apple games" "game of thrones", and after these searches, if user types !recent game, the bot replies with "apple games" and "game of thrones". User search history is persistent. PSQL is used to store searches, so even when we kill nodejs server and start again, search history is maintained.
